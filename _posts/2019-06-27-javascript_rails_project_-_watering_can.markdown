Starting out, I thought that this project was going to take a lot more time than it actually did. The video lectures provided were extremely helpful to me when updating my app. My app's models include a dispenser which has many plants (a plant belongs to a dispenser) and more. I decided to focus on this relationship for the javascript portion. The first thing I did was render the index of plants a dispenser has via JS, then when a user clicks on one of the plants, it renders the plants "show" info underneath. Getting these functions to work wasn't too much of a struggle - I learned quickly how important console.log() is when debugging. 

Next, I wanted to implement a form on the same page that a user can rename thier dispenser with. When they click on the dispenser's name, it shows a field to rename it. When submitted, it shows the dispenser's new name that if clicked can also be renamed as many times as they want. This one was slightly more difficult because I originally thought I wanted to use Handlebars but it ended up being simpler just doing it the way I coded the previous JS functions. Overall I'm proud of my new JavaScript/JQuery/AJAX skills and am excited to move on to the next lesson.
