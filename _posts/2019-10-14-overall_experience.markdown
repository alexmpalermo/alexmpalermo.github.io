It looks like this blog post is the last requirement before I finish my coding course. To be honest I am the worst at writing blog posts, but I did enjoy all the coding activities and projects for Flatiron School. My favorite part is usually the HTML/CSS part of the projects because I like to be creative and see the changes as I code. Probably the most challenging parts were Javascript and React, but once you get the hang of it it's not too bad. 

I enjoy making little websites and apps for myself just to have a creative outlet but I don't think I'll be doing this as a full-time job. I appreciate everything I've learned and the videos helped me out the most throughout this experience. I don't know if I would have been able to finish some of the activities without them. 

What I'm most proud of is definitely all of my main projects, The football picks app I might fix up and turn into a real app so my mom can use it instead of an excel sheet where she has to calculate everything out, but that is to be decided. The watering plants app I personally think is the coolest idea but I don't think I'd have the mechanics behind it anytime soon. I'd say if I were to make a new app project, I'd do another one related to my sales job to try and streamline some of those processes so that inputting fax and email orders is more efficient.
