When I got out of college, I started working as a salesperson at company that happened to be the largest distributor of medical and dental products. We used an excel file to keep track of what customers buy which spiff items and when. If I thought they needed the products, I would pitch it to them. This is the idea behind my project "Sales Helper". 

I wanted to make an app that allows sales reps to add and keep thier customers in a database. When they call or go visit the person (in my case doctor's offices), they input what items were sold and the quantity. The program automatically saves the date and stores it in the customer's page. When they look back at the customer's page it shows what items the program thinks the customer needs now, is running low on, just bought, and hasn't purchased in over a year. So basically it's taking that excel file and making it easier to see what the customers need so you waste less time researching. 

Going though this project was actually not as hard as I thought it would be. The thing that was the most challenging to me was just getting the css to work. I had a lot of fun making this because I really like designing my own things and coming up with my own ideas for projects. I look forward to learning more about coding and especially working with Rails.
