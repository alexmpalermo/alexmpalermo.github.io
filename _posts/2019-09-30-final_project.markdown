This project definitely took me the most amount of time to complete. It forced me to learn many new things, but I'm happy it did. My mom runs a football pool with our coworkers, but it takes her a long time to calculate all the scores and send out the emails, so I wanted to make an app that makes it easier for everyone. 

What challenged me the most during this project was debugging. Sometimes it's easy to console log, but other times it would give no information on how to fix something and it took a little longer. I realized that starting from the beginning and re-tracing the steps the app goes through to display something helps. 

I learned a lot more information on building tables with html/css and what you can/cannot do with them. I also added an admin section where I can input weekly game winners and spreads. I would have just gotten info via api, but the websites were requiring payment for that. 

Overall I think it looks pretty cool. Yes there are a few things I would change if I decide to make it into a real working app such as: grabbing weekly NFL info from an external api, adding payment options, and having the css change more accurately based on screen size.
